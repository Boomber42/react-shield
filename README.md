# S.H.I.E.L.D. website using react

In this project, the objective is to simulate a S.H.I.E.L.D.-like website where the user can add information regarding agents, Avengers, or even add objects or special vehicles used by their favorite heroes.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run mock-server`

There is a mocked database in this project, which can be started with the command 'npm run mock-server'. It is not mandatory to start this database, as the site works equally without it being started. However, all extra information added by the user will be deleted as soon as the page is updated. With the database running, all information will be saved.
Open [http://localhost:4000/](http://localhost:4000/) to view it in the browser.
